# Style Pages

The goal of this project is to grow into a full style guide generation app for designing in browser. This is an adaptation of the wonderful Style Guide built by [Mason Wendell](http://twitter.com/codingdesigner) for his kick ass [Survival Kit](http://github.com/canarymason/survival-kit).
